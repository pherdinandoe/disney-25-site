                    <p class="mt-3">My favorite moment was probably riding Tower of Terror. There was a ton of anticipation and some fear going into it, but in the end the ride was super fun and thrilling. <br><br> Hollywood Studios was a great park and maybe my favorite because of the variety of spaces and really good rides. Star Wars land and the Hollywood street were really impressive and fun to walk through. And even after a full day of rides, since it was the first park of the trip, it was good to know that there was a lot more to come.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Getting on cosmic rewind (obviously). Getting Everybody Wants to Rule the World was a buzz I have yet to feel since. Also, my ultimate favorite moments were the times we got to hang out and laugh in the hotel. It was really nice and funny and reminded me that it’s not so much the place you’re at but rather the people you’re with. Also, I loved going to the cafeteria literally every single time.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">My favorite moment at the happiest place on earth was the night we got there. The anticipation for what was to come was electric and I wish we could go back there. The rest of the trip was magical but that beginning was everything.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">I enjoyed Animal Kingdom the best. Specially getting to experience expedition everest for the first time and the thrill of being so close to the front for my first time. Animal Kingdom is my favorite park so being able to experience everything they have to offer-and it being semi cool that day was so much fun!</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="mt-3">I learned the difference between a mid chocolate mousse and a good chocolate mousse. I also learned that I could never live in Florida. <br><br> Overall, this trip was an awesome way for me to take a real break, even when the sun was beating down or I was falling asleep on a ride. It was great to feel totally disconnected from everything and like we were in a Disney bubble. It reminded me of how important it is to take vacations to rest and also to make memories that you can take with you for a long time. I still have memories of when I went to Disney World when I was ~14 years old, so it was fun to be able to revisit what I remembered while also experiencing all the new stuff they've made to the parks.<br><br>I was a little skeptical of a Disney trip being worth the cost, but I'm happy I was able to go. It was definitely worth being able to spend so much quality time with my friends and just have fun!</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Sunscreen is a must and really does work if you apply as instructed. Additionally, I am out of shape. Additionally-additionally, Mickey Waffles really are that good. Finally, closing out the world and being in your own bubble with your friends for a whole week is absolutely healing for mind, body, and soul.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Something I learned during this trip was that Disney claims to grow all of their food in-house. The living with the land ride, though slow, was very educational. I also learned that I don't like Figment.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">The thing that stands out to me most is the overall stay we had. I regret not staying on campus during my college years because this brief experience, of sharing a room with friends, having basically a little town to ourselves, and not having any worries was something I think college life would've felt like. 
                    <br><br> Overall, this was an amazing trip and I would love to do it again with the same, and even more people <3 10/10 </p>
